This is an implementation of DictionaryDaemon (DD)
it will be initiated as daemon and will display its PID before going in the backend and after that it will be running 
and keep listening to a specific message queue for queries from client.

keywords is the file which contains string/int pair and which should be used to initialize our DD.
Once initialized DD will keep all the data in memory in a structured way without consuming much memory and is designed to 
give lightning fast responses.
Tested for 80000 string/int pair and found no delay in response.

You can either use the following commands or use the make file directly

gcc hashtable.c
./a.out keywords


run client for any query and to talk to daemon
gcc -o c.o client.c

./c.o keyword1
./c.o keyword2

etc.
